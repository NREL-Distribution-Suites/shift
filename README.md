# NREL-shift

A Python framework for building synthetic power distribution feeder models from open-source geospatial data. NREL-shift fetches building parcels and road networks from OpenStreetMap, constructs graph-based network topologies, and exports simulator-ready models through [Grid Data Models](https://github.com/NREL-Distribution-Suites/grid-data-models) and [Ditto](https://github.com/NREL-Distribution-Suites/ditto).

## Features

- **Automated Feeder Generation** — Build distribution feeder models directly from OpenStreetMap data
- **Graph-Based Network Modeling** — Represent distribution networks as NetworkX graphs with typed nodes and edges
- **Equipment Mapping** — Assign transformers, loads, and other equipment to network components
- **Phase Balancing** — Automatically balance phases across distribution transformers
- **Voltage Mapping** — Assign voltage levels throughout the distribution network based on transformer topology
- **Visualization** — Built-in Plotly-based plotting for parcels, networks, and phase/voltage overlays
- **Simulator Export** — Write models to OpenDSS, CYME, Synergi, and other simulators via Grid Data Models

## Installation

pip install -e ".[dev,doc,mcp]"
```

## Quick Start

The typical workflow has four stages: **fetch data → build graph → configure mappers → build system**.

### 1. Fetch Parcels and Road Network

```python
from shift import parcels_from_location, get_road_network, GeoLocation
from gdm.quantities import Distance

# Fetch building parcels from OpenStreetMap
parcels = parcels_from_location("Fort Worth, TX", Distance(500, "m"))

# Fetch the road network for the same area
road_network = get_road_network("Fort Worth, TX", Distance(500, "m"))
```

You can also pass coordinates instead of an address:

```python
location = GeoLocation(longitude=-97.3, latitude=32.75)
parcels = parcels_from_location(location, Distance(500, "m"))
```

### 2. Build a Distribution Graph

```python
from shift import get_kmeans_clusters, PRSG, GeoLocation

# Cluster parcels for transformer placement (~2 customers per transformer)
parcel_points = [
    p.geometry[0] if isinstance(p.geometry, list) else p.geometry
    for p in parcels
]
clusters = get_kmeans_clusters(max(len(parcels) // 2, 1), parcel_points)

# Build the distribution graph from clusters and road network
builder = PRSG(
    groups=clusters,
    source_location=GeoLocation(-97.3, 32.75),
)
graph = builder.get_distribution_graph()
```

### 3. Configure Mappers and Build the System

```python
from shift import (
    BalancedPhaseMapper,
    TransformerVoltageMapper,
    EdgeEquipmentMapper,
    DistributionSystemBuilder,
    TransformerPhaseMapperModel,
    TransformerVoltageModel,
    TransformerTypes,
)
from gdm import DistributionTransformer
from gdm.quantities import ApparentPower, Voltage

# Phase mapper — assign phases to transformer secondaries
transformer_phase_models = [
    TransformerPhaseMapperModel(
        tr_name=edge.name,
        tr_type=TransformerTypes.SPLIT_PHASE,
        tr_capacity=ApparentPower(25, "kilovoltampere"),
        location=graph.get_node(from_node).location,
    )
    for from_node, _, edge in graph.get_edges()
    if edge.edge_type is DistributionTransformer
]
phase_mapper = BalancedPhaseMapper(graph, mapper=transformer_phase_models, method="agglomerative")

# Voltage mapper — assign primary/secondary voltages
voltage_mapper = TransformerVoltageMapper(
    graph,
    xfmr_voltage=[
        TransformerVoltageModel(
            name=edge.name,
            voltages=[Voltage(7.2, "kilovolt"), Voltage(120, "volt")],
        )
        for _, _, edge in graph.get_edges()
        if edge.edge_type is DistributionTransformer
    ],
)

# Build the system
from pathlib import Path
from gdm import DistributionSystem
import shift

MODELS_FOLDER = Path(shift.__file__).parent.parent.parent / "tests" / "models"
catalog_sys = DistributionSystem.from_json(MODELS_FOLDER / "p1rhs7_1247.json")

system = DistributionSystemBuilder(
    name="fort_worth_feeder",
    dist_graph=graph,
    phase_mapper=phase_mapper,
    voltage_mapper=voltage_mapper,
    equipment_mapper=EdgeEquipmentMapper(graph, catalog_sys, voltage_mapper, phase_mapper),
)
distribution_system = system.get_system()
```
