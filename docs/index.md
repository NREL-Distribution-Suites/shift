# NREL-shift 

Python package for developing power distribution model using opensource data. This package 
uses [Grid Data Models](https://github.nrel.gov/CADET/grid-data-models) to represent power distribution components and [Ditto](https://github.nrel.gov/CADET/ditto) for writing case files specific to simulators such as OpenDSS, Cyme, Synergi and others.

Primarily this package will leverage open street parcels, road network to build out distribution model.
