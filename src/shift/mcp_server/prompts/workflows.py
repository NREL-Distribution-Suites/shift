"{location}" with a search radius of {distance_meters} meters.

Follow these steps in order:

1. **Fetch parcels**: Use `fetch_parcels` with the location and distance.
2. **Cluster parcels**: Use `cluster_parcels` on the parcel centroids to form
   groups of about 5-10 parcels each.
3. **Build graph**: Use `build_graph_from_groups` with the cluster groups and
   choose an appropriate source (voltage source) location near the center.
4. **Configure phase mapper**: Use `configure_phase_mapper` with the graph.
   Use 3 single-phase transformers per group as a starting configuration.
5. **Configure voltage mapper**: Use `configure_voltage_mapper` with primary
   voltage 12.47 kV and secondary voltage 0.24 kV.
6. **Configure equipment mapper**: Use `configure_equipment_mapper` with the
   default NREL equipment catalog.
7. **Build system**: Use `build_system` to create the final distribution system.
8. **Export**: Use `export_system_json` to save the model.

After each step, report what was created and any relevant statistics.
